This is a placeholder for the architecture_diagram.png file.

Since I can't directly create a PNG file, you'll need to:
1. Use the SVG file I've created (assets/architecture_diagram.svg)
2. Convert it to PNG using an online converter like https://svgtopng.com/ or any SVG to PNG converter
3. Save the resulting file as architecture_diagram.png in the assets folder

Alternatively, you can use Flutter's SVG package to directly use the SVG in your app.
